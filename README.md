## 🤔 Why Charlatan?

<br>

**Charlatan** makes it simple for writers to build profiles of their original characters. Whether you're working on a novel, screenplay, or another creative project, Charlatan is the right tool for swiftly and efficiently jotting down details of your original characters. Furthermore, because of its minimal user interface, it allows writers to easily customise every aspect of their character's profile, from gender to backstory to motivations.

Whether you're a seasoned novelist or a first-time writer, Charlatan is the perfect tool to help you create compelling characters that your readers will fall in love with.
